Just a quick update that I've moved the site over to a full domain, [truggeri.com](https://www.truggeri.com).
Github Pages is really cool about offering this feature with their hosting, so along with 
[CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) I'm up and running on my own domain.

In the future I plan on adding my resume and maybe a few more static pages to the site, but for now it works. I'll soon
have a new post on my experimentation with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and 
[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).
