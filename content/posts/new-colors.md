A small note that I've changed the site color from the default theme blue to [NC State Wolfpack red](https://brand.ncsu.edu/color/). Hopefully I've gotten everything and there isn't some stray blue out there.

After watching enough college basketball on ESPN, the chevron pattern really grew on me so I've included that, using only CSS, in the top header. It took me a bit of playing around with, but I really like [this example on Codepen](https://codepen.io/mmckinnon/pen/LJnzG) (thanks to Megan McKinnon for that). It uses gradients that are very thin and sharp, thus more like lines, that are calculated to be the right angle for a given width to height ratio to make a repeating pattern.
